# Implementation of a SCADA Solution for the Classification System of Hollow Cylindrical Products Based on the 'Feeding, Checking, Sorting, and Storing' Functions

The study "Implementation of a SCADA Solution for the Classification System of Hollow Cylindrical Products Based on the 'Feeding, Checking, Sorting, and Storing' Functions" focuses on developing an automated system to classify hollow cylindrical products. The system integrates SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) technology to monitor and control the processes of feeding, inspecting, sorting, and storing products.

The design involves a combination of hardware and software components, including sensors for quality checks, actuators for material handling, and a central SCADA interface for real-time data visualization and control. The classification is based on predefined parameters such as dimensions, colors properties & enhanced data by RFID.

The solution aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in industrial environments by minimizing manual intervention. It also provides advanced monitoring capabilities, allowing for system diagnostics, fault detection, and operational optimization. This SCADA-based approach ensures consistent product quality and streamlined production workflows.
